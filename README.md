# C-practice-problems

🚀 Daily C Practice

This repository contains my daily C programming practice.
I’m revising C concepts and solving problems step by step — focusing on building a strong foundation before moving to C++ and DSA.

📅 Progress Log :
Day	Topic / Concept	         Problems Practiced

🎯 Goals : 

• Revise C concepts (basics → pointers → memory → structures).

• Practice 2–3 problems daily for consistency.

• Build strong fundamentals before diving into C++ OOP + DSA.

🛠️ Tech Stack :

• Language → C

• IDE → Dev C++

• Version control → Git + GitHub

📌 Notes :

• This is a learning repo → expect mistakes & corrections.

• I’ll update daily with new problems and notes.

• Feel free to suggest better solutions 🚀
